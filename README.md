Github repository for my summer course IZG of 2nd semester at BUT FIT.

Start at start_here.html where is the assignment described.

The size is so large because I wanted to have everything in one place.

Build directory is for building the output.

The only files I changed are: 
	gpu.cpp gpu.hpp pphongMethod.cpp phongMethod.hpp

These are also the files that I turned in.

All files were created by Tomáš Milet, imilet@fit.vutbr.cz.
All ownership of code other than I changed goes to him and to BUT FIT.
